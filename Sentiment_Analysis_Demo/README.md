# Sentiment Analysis Demonstration (RStudio)

Since the R code and methods used in the original project are privately protected by the City College of New York, I have included a demonstration of the sentiment analysis techniques used in this folder.

All methods shown are those used in the original transit/sentiment analysis project.

## Comparing word frequencies of the Jane Austen library to the Bronte Sisters' and H.G. Wellsl libraries.
- While this concept wasn't used in the Tweet/Transit study, this concept could have been used had we conducted a study regarding the difference in word frequencies/post sentiment across different social media platforms.
