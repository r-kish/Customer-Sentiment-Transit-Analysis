# Tweet Sentiment Transit Analysis

This project started during my civil engineering studies at the City College of New York, and right when I started concentrating on Transportation Engineering. This was also my first deep dive into R, and the project that made me want to switch from engineering to pursue data analysis.

The duration of my research was conducted between July 2020 and June 2023. The following research paper is published in Sustainability, and C2SMART in collaboration with USDOT and New York University.
