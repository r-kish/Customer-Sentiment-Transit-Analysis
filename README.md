# Tweet Sentiment Transit Analysis

This project started during my civil engineering studies at the City College of New York, and right when I started concentrating on Transportation Engineering. This was also my first deep dive into R, and the project that made me want to switch from engineering to pursue data analysis. 

The project represents the New York Metropolitan Area, and covers an in-depth review of sentiment analysis conducted over a period of time on 300,000+ tweets related to MTA and New Jersey Transit agencies such as NYC Transit, Metro-North Railroad, and Long Island Rail Road. Additionally, transit performance analysis was conducted on the same date range as the transit-related tweets across the various transit agencies. A longitudinal study was conducted, comparing the tweet sentiment and transit performance from 2015-2016 (Pre-COVID era) to that of 2020-2021 (Post-COVID era). The findings suggest that customer social media behavior, and their concerns regarding transit performance, change in the wake of a natural disaster such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

The duration of my research was conducted between July 2020 and June 2023. The following research paper is published in Sustainability, and C2SMART in collaboration with USDOT and New York University.
